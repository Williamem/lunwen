## Political laws, decisions and considerations

A non comprehensive list of laws and regulations affecting the Swedish Nuclear energy industry

### 1941 års strålskyddslag
The first Swedish law concerning handling and possesion of radioactive material. At the time radioactive material was used in medicin and for research, nuclear bombs and nuclear reactors were not a considerations since they hadn't been invented yet and the concepts weren't widely known.

### Stenkolslagen och gruvlagen
in 1945 mining laws were changed to make uranium mining and extraction reqiring royal concession while banning export. In 1950 the law was changed to allow for export with royal permission in order to be able to export uranium to Norway. This was nessecary since Sweden were to supply uranium to Norway who in turn would supply Sweden with heavy water. In 1953 thorium and weryllium were added to the law being regulated like uranium.

### The atomic Energy Act (America)
In 1946 America bans all export of nuclear technology and know how meaning that other countries wishing to go nuclear had to create their own nuclear programmes.

### Atomkommittén
In 1945, after the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Swedish prime minister Tage Erlander instigated an enquiry the would result in the appointment of atomkommittén, the Atomic committee to support reasearch in nuclear physics and chemistry. They would soon become the administring body for all swedish nuclear research. They did not formally have responsibility for bomb development but half of the commissioners belonged to FOA. In 1946 Erlander approved 2 000 000SEK for nuclear education at a suggestion from Atomkommittén.

### Proposition 1947:313
Proposition 1947:313, 1947 led to the founding of AB Atomenergi, a company responsible for constructing facillities neede för a national nuclear program. The state had a majority share in the company with 24 private comanies owning 43% of the shares.

### U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954
in 1953 American President Dwight D. Eisenhower held a peace to the UN general assembly where he declared American plans to share both nuclear technology and materials with other countries under the conditions that the materials would not be used for making nuclear weapons. This required a new law: U.S. Atomic Energy Act of 1954 which also allowed private American comanies access to nuclear technology.

### ÖB-54
In 1954 an enquiry from the Swedish Commande in Chief (ÖB), called for arming Swedish forces with Nuclear weapons. The Swedish goverment was more interested in using the atom for electrical power production but had not abandoned weapons development.

### Atoms for peace
in 1954 the UN conference Atoms For Peace was held in which the nuclear powers shared large amounts of previously classified information. Enriched uranium was also made availlible to states not intending to use it for weapon development making light water reactors a possibility. Another consequence of the conference was the establishing by the UN of IAEA in 1957.

### the Swedish goverment officially discuss nuclear waepons
in 1955 the Swedish goverment have perhaps the first discussion concerning development of nuclear weapons. The idea of constructing reactors specifically for production of weapons grade plutonium was dismissed since a lack of qualified personnel would mean that military needs would compete with civillian needs.

### Atomenergiutredningen
The same day that AKK was founded prime minister Erlander announced that the goverment was planning to investigate cicilian development of nuclear power. This resulted in Atomenergiutredning being appointed 21 December the same year.
