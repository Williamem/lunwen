## The beginning
In August 1945 America dropped two nuclear bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In Sweden as in most of the world this shocked us into the nuclear age. The same autumn FOA requested funds to begin research. To the military access to atomic bombs would be important for a small country such as Sweden. To the rest of swedish society however the peaceful use of the atom took presedence.

In november of 1945 Atomkommittén (the atomic committee) was established with represantatvies from goverment, military, industry and the scientific community, their job was to plan for future research and find methods for peacful use of atomic energy. The first committee report was delivered in 1946 with hopes of ”att en ny och mäktig energikälla skall kunna ställas i det fredliga framåtskridandets tjänst”. Their opinion was that this new power source should be developed by the state with involvement from industry. In 1947 AB Atomenergi (Atomic energy LLC) was established with the state as majority owner.

Initial reseach was mainly focused on producing uranium and separation of plutonium from irradiated uranium. The task of initiating research was put to FOA in 1946. Sweden was to be self sufficent in energy production, this was the beginning of the swedish line.

## The Swedish Line
(atomenergiutredningen)
in a 1956 committee report from atomenergiutredningen (the atomic energy committee) concerning future civilian nuclear technology atomkommittén set up what came to be known as "den svenska linjen", "the swedish line". it set up guildlines for making the swedish nuclear industry self sufficent. Due to the recently ended second world war self sufficency was seen as an importand measure to handle future conflict and crisis. To achive self sufficency Sweden would need to establish a complete nuclear fuel cycle based on domestically sourced uranium used in heavy water moderated reactors. The program was to be undertaken by the state and be an integrated part of the swedish nuclear weapons program. The planned reactors were to be used both for power production and for producing weapons grade plutonium. Heavy water was to be procured from neighboring Norway who had shown interest in trading heavy water for uranium for which they lacked demestic sources.

## Swedish uranium/Ranstadsverket, Ranstad uranium mine
It was known since 1893 that sweden had sources of uranium in the form of alum shale. The ore was found in mid sweden, mainly in Närke, Västergörland and Östergötland. After it's founding AB Atomenergi started prospecting alum shale for it's uranium content and eventually settled on establishing an open cast mine close to Ranstad (1) between Skövde and Falun where the uranium content of the alun shale was 300g/t. Permission and funds to establish the mine was given in 1959 and it was ready to begin operations in 1965 under Ranstad mineral. By the end of the 1960s prices on uranium on the global market had come down, this combined with low concentrations of uranium in the alum shale made the ranstad mine unprofitable and in 1969 operations ceased until further notice. After the oil crisis in 1973 prices of uranium again increased and the mine could become profitable. LKAB entered as a partner and applied to reopen the mine in 1975 and 1977, due to local opposition they were unsuccesful and the mine stayed closed. During the 1970s the facillity was used for research concerning extraction of uranium and other minerals, this research ceased in 1982 due to lack of interest for swedish uranim extraction by the nuclear industry. The concession for the mine ended in 1984 and the pit was restored 1990-1992 at a cost of 250 000 000 SEK(2), paid by the Swedish nuclear industry. Some activity still occured at the facillity in the form of uranium extraction from waste produced during fuel production from 1982-2009 when the licence expired, activity was already low due to intesified security regulation instated in the beginning of the 2000's Low concentrations of uranium and high demands on enviromental protection makes it unlikely that a uranium mine in the area will become profitable in the near future ~~to cover the current needs for uranium the pit would need to expand by 0.8km2 per year~~ In total the mine produced around 200 tonnes of uranium(2)

## Atomenergiutredningen

## Getting started - knowledge, materials and experimental reactors
In America the atomic bomb project, later the manhattan project was formally authorized by Roosevelt on 19 January 1942. Less than a year later the worlds first man made self sustaining nuclear reaction begins as Chicago Pile-1 first achives criticallity.

Just days after showing the world their success in nuclear technology by dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in Japan, Prineton University Press published "Atomic Energy for Military Purposes", more known as "The Smyth Report". The report was an offical account of the development of the atomic bomb and also served as an indication as to what information concerning the project was declassified. The scientific information in the report focused heavily on what was already know within the wider scientific community and what could easily be deduced by a competent acientist. Despite being careful in what information it gave away it was studied with great interest in other countries looking do develop nuclear programs.

Not having a war to win the swedish nuclear programme was not in the same hurry to reach results. In 1946 FOA was tasked with initiating research and three great needs were quickly identified: academics with relevant knowledge, uranium and heavy water. The lack of qualified personnel lead to to majority of FOA's nuclear physics section being transferred to AB Atomenergi in 1950, the knowledge needed to proceed with the military nuclear programme was the same as it was in the civilian programme. Also in 1950 a cooperation agreement was struck with France in which they would lend three tonnes of uranium to sweden to be returned when the swedish production got started. Heavy water was procured from Norway and the construction of swedens first nuclear reactor R1 began in the same year.

### R1
R1 (Reaktor 1) in stockholm achived first criticallity 18:59 13 July 1954 taking Sweden in to the atomic age. The core was loaded with three tonnes of natural metallic uranium encapsulated in an aluminum alloy moderated with 5 tonnes of heavy water using grafite as a neutron reflector. R1 was a research reactor used to test calculations as a proof of concept and also had an irradiaton chamber for further studies. It initially had a thermal effect of 300kW later raised to 1MW. Thea reactor was neither capable of power production or plutonium production but as a practice project it was invaluble. R1 was finally closed down on June 6 1970.

### R0
R0 was the second Swedish nuclear reactor built in Studsvik. Also a heavy water moderated, naural uranium fueled research reactor not for power production it was mainly used for research on core configaritions and fuel reqirements. I was closed down in 1972 ~~fanns den på riktigt?~~

### R2
~~inte färdig~~
R2 was a research reactor in studsvik of the same design as ORR in America delivered to AB Atomenergi by american company Allis-Chalmers. It went critical May 4 1960 and was used for materials research, fuel research, neutron experiments and production av radio-isotopes for medicin and industry. It closed down in 2005.


### Atoms for peace
During the first years after the second world war America banned the sharing of nuclear technology, even with their allies. This began to change after a 1953 speech to the Un general assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower about the hopes and dangers of a nuclear future. After this America became more generous in sharing information and equipment. In 1957 a UN conferens was helt concerning nuclear technology in which lots of previously secret information was released to the world. The nuclear states also agreed to the trade of both natural and enriched uranium. This eventually lead to the founding of IAEA in 1957 which were to regulate and control the trade. This sped up the development in Sweden leading to AB Atomenergi suggesting two new reactors, R3 and R4 as well as the founding of privately owned AKK (later OKG) who eventually became the first in sweden to consider construction of a light water reactor.

## future plans for power production

## Nuclear power plants
~~~lite om rickover?~~
The worlds first civilian nuclear power plant, The Shippingport Atomic power station, unique in that it had no military purpose, first went critical December 12, 1957 and started putting power on the grid five months later on May 26, 1958. ~~kafa, flytta eller skriva om~~
