## The beginning
In August 1945 America dropped two nuclear bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In Sweden as in most of the world this shocked us into the nuclear age. The same autumn FOA requested funds to begin research. To the military access to atomic bombs would be important for a small country such as Sweden. To the rest of swedish society however the peaceful use of the atom took presedence.

In november of 1945 Atomkommittén (the atomic committee) was established with represantatvies from goverment, military, industry and the scientific community, their job was to plan for future research and find methods for peacful use of atomic energy. The first committee report was delivered in 1946 with hopes of ”att en ny och mäktig energikälla skall kunna ställas i det fredliga framåtskridandets tjänst”. Their opinion was that this new power source should be developed by the state with involvement from industry. In 1947 AB Atomenergi (Atomic energy LLC) was established with the state as majority owner.

Initial reseach was mainly focused on producing uranium and separation of plutonium from irradiated uranium. The task of initiating research was put to FOA in 1946. Sweden was to be self sufficent in energy production, this was the beginning of the swedish line.

## The Swedish Line
(atomenergiutredningen)
in a 1956 committee report concerning future civilian nuclear technology atomkommittén set up what came to be known as "den svenska linjen", "the swedish line". it set up guildlines for making the swedish nuclear industry self sufficent. Due to the recently ended second world war self sufficency was seen as an importand measure to handle future conflict and crisis. To achive self sufficency Sweden would need to establish a --komplett kärnbränslecykel-- based on domestically sourced uranium used in heavy water moderated reactors. The program was to be undertaken by the state and be an integrated part of the swedish nuclear weapons program. The planned reactors were to be used both for power production and for producing weapons grade plutonium. Heavy water was to be procured from neighboring Norway who had shown interest in trading heavy water for uranium for which they lacked demestic sources.

## Swedish uranium/Ranstadsverket, Ranstad uranium mine
It was known since 1893 that sweden had sources of uranium in the form of alum shale. The ore was found in mid sweden, mainly in Närke, Västergörland and Östergötland. After it's founding AB Atomenergi started prospecting alum shale for it's uranium content and eventually settled on establishing an open cast mine close to Ranstad (1) between Skövde and Falun where the uranium content of the alun shale was 300g/t. Permission and funds to establish the mine was given in 1959 and it was ready to begin operations in 1965 under Ranstad mineral.
