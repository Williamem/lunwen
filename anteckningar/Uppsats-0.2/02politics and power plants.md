## The beginning
In August 1945 America dropped two nuclear bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In Sweden as in most of the world this shocked us into the nuclear age. The same autumn FOA requested funds to begin research. To the military access to atomic bombs would be important for a small country such as Sweden. To the rest of swedish society however the peaceful use of the atom took presedence.

In november of 1945 Atomkommittén (the atomic committee) was established with represantatvies from goverment, military, industry and the scientific community, their job was to plan for future research and find methods for peacful use of atomic energy. The first committee report was delivered in 1946 with hopes of ”att en ny och mäktig energikälla skall kunna ställas i det fredliga framåtskridandets tjänst”. Their opinion was that this new power source should be developed by the state with involvement from industry. In 1947 AB Atomenergi (Atomic energy LLC) was established with the state as majority owner.

Initial reseach was mainly focused on producing uranium and separation of plutonium from irradiated uranium. The task of initiating research was put to FOA in 1946. Sweden was to be self sufficent in energy production, this was the beginning of the swedish line.

## The Swedish Line
(atomenergiutredningen)
in a 1956 committee report from atomenergiutredningen (the atomic energy committee) concerning future civilian nuclear technology atomkommittén set up what came to be known as "den svenska linjen", "the swedish line". it set up guildlines for making the swedish nuclear industry self sufficent. Due to the recently ended second world war self sufficency was seen as an importand measure to handle future conflict and crisis. To achive self sufficency Sweden would need to establish a complete nuclear fuel cycle based on domestically sourced uranium used in heavy water moderated reactors. The program was to be undertaken by the state and be an integrated part of the swedish nuclear weapons program. The planned reactors were to be used both for power production and for producing weapons grade plutonium. Heavy water was to be procured from neighboring Norway who had shown interest in trading heavy water for uranium for which they lacked demestic sources.

## Swedish uranium/Ranstadsverket, Ranstad uranium mine
It was known since 1893 that sweden had sources of uranium in the form of alum shale. The ore was found in mid sweden, mainly in Närke, Västergörland and Östergötland. After it's founding AB Atomenergi started prospecting alum shale for it's uranium content and eventually settled on establishing an open cast mine close to Ranstad (1) between Skövde and Falun where the uranium content of the alun shale was 300g/t. Permission and funds to establish the mine was given in 1959 and it was ready to begin operations in 1965 under Ranstad mineral. By the end of the 1960s prices on uranium on the global market had come down, this combined with low concentrations of uranium in the alum shale made the ranstad mine unprofitable and in 1969 operations ceased until further notice. After the oil crisis in 1973 prices of uranium again increased and the mine could become profitable. LKAB entered as a partner and applied to reopen the mine in 1975 and 1977, due to local opposition they were unsuccesful and the mine stayed closed. During the 1970s the facillity was used for research concerning extraction of uranium and other minerals, this research ceased in 1982 due to lack of interest for swedish uranim extraction by the nuclear industry. The concession for the mine ended in 1984 and the pit was restored 1990-1992 at a cost of 250 000 000 SEK(2), paid by the Swedish nuclear industry. Some activity still occured at the facillity in the form of uranium extraction from waste produced during fuel production from 1982-2009 when the licence expired, activity was already low due to intesified security regulation instated in the beginning of the 2000's Low concentrations of uranium and high demands on enviromental protection makes it unlikely that a uranium mine in the area will become profitable in the near future ~~to cover the current needs for uranium the pit would need to expand by 0.8km2 per year~~ In total the mine produced around 200 tonnes of uranium(2)
