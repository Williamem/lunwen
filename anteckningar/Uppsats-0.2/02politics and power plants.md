## The beginning
In August 1945 America dropped two nuclear bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In Sweden as in most of the world this shocked us into the nuclear age. The same autumn FOA requested funds to begin research. To the military access to atomic bombs would be important for a small country such as Sweden. To the rest of swedish society however the peaceful use of the atom took presedence.

In november of 1945 Atomkommittén (the atomic committee) was established with represantatvies from goverment, military, industry and the scientific community, their job was to plan for future research and find methods for peacful use of atomic energy. The first committee report was delivered in 1946 with hopes of ”att en ny och mäktig energikälla skall kunna ställas i det fredliga framåtskridandets tjänst”. Their opinion was that this new power source should be developed by the state with involvement from industry. In 1947 AB Atomenergi (Atomic energy LLC) was established with the state as majority owner.

Initial reseach was mainly focused on producing uranium and separation of plutonium from irradiated uranium. The task of initiating research was put to FOA in 1946. Sweden was to be self sufficent in energy production, this was the beginning of the swedish line.

## The Swedish Line
(atomenergiutredningen)
in a 1956 committee report from atomenergiutredningen (the atomic energy committee) concerning future civilian nuclear technology atomkommittén set up what came to be known as "den svenska linjen", "the swedish line". it set up guildlines for making the swedish nuclear industry self sufficent. Due to the recently ended second world war self sufficency was seen as an importand measure to handle future conflict and crisis. To achive self sufficency Sweden would need to establish a complete nuclear fuel cycle based on domestically sourced uranium used in heavy water moderated reactors. The program was to be undertaken by the state and be an integrated part of the swedish nuclear weapons program. The planned reactors were to be used both for power production and for producing weapons grade plutonium. Heavy water was to be procured from neighboring Norway who had shown interest in trading heavy water for uranium for which they lacked demestic sources.

## Swedish uranium/Ranstadsverket, Ranstad uranium mine
It was known since 1893 that sweden had sources of uranium in the form of alum shale. The ore was found in mid sweden, mainly in Närke, Västergörland and Östergötland. After it's founding AB Atomenergi started prospecting alum shale for it's uranium content and eventually settled on establishing an open cast mine close to Ranstad (1) between Skövde and Falun where the uranium content of the alun shale was 300g/t. Permission and funds to establish the mine was given in 1959 and it was ready to begin operations in 1965 under Ranstad mineral. By the end of the 1960s prices on uranium on the global market had come down, this combined with low concentrations of uranium in the alum shale made the ranstad mine unprofitable and in 1969 operations ceased until further notice. After the oil crisis in 1973 prices of uranium again increased and the mine could become profitable. LKAB entered as a partner and applied to reopen the mine in 1975 and 1977, due to local opposition they were unsuccesful and the mine stayed closed. During the 1970s the facillity was used for research concerning extraction of uranium and other minerals, this research ceased in 1982 due to lack of interest for swedish uranim extraction by the nuclear industry. The concession for the mine ended in 1984 and the pit was restored 1990-1992 at a cost of 250 000 000 SEK(2), paid by the Swedish nuclear industry. Some activity still occured at the facillity in the form of uranium extraction from waste produced during fuel production from 1982-2009 when the licence expired, activity was already low due to intesified security regulation instated in the beginning of the 2000's Low concentrations of uranium and high demands on enviromental protection makes it unlikely that a uranium mine in the area will become profitable in the near future ~~to cover the current needs for uranium the pit would need to expand by 0.8km2 per year~~ In total the mine produced around 200 tonnes of uranium(2)

## Atomenergiutredningen

## Getting started - knowledge, materials and experimental reactors
In America the atomic bomb project, later the manhattan project was formally authorized by Roosevelt on 19 January 1942. Less than a year later the worlds first man made self sustaining nuclear reaction begins as Chicago Pile-1 first achives criticallity.

Just days after showing the world their success in nuclear technology by dropping an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in Japan, Prineton University Press published "Atomic Energy for Military Purposes", more known as "The Smyth Report". The report was an offical account of the development of the atomic bomb and also served as an indication as to what information concerning the project was declassified. The scientific information in the report focused heavily on what was already know within the wider scientific community and what could easily be deduced by a competent acientist. Despite being careful in what information it gave away it was studied with great interest in other countries looking do develop nuclear programs.

Not having a war to win the swedish nuclear programme was not in the same hurry to reach results. In 1946 FOA was tasked with initiating research and three great needs were quickly identified: academics with relevant knowledge, uranium and heavy water. The lack of qualified personnel lead to to majority of FOA's nuclear physics section being transferred to AB Atomenergi in 1950, the knowledge needed to proceed with the military nuclear programme was the same as it was in the civilian programme. Also in 1950 a cooperation agreement was struck with France in which they would lend three tonnes of uranium to sweden to be returned when the swedish production got started. Heavy water was procured from Norway and the construction of swedens first nuclear reactor R1 began in the same year.

### R1
R1 (Reaktor 1) in stockholm achived first criticallity 18:59 13 July 1954 taking Sweden in to the atomic age. The core was loaded with three tonnes of natural metallic uranium encapsulated in an aluminum alloy moderated with 5 tonnes of heavy water using grafite as a neutron reflector. R1 was a research reactor used to test calculations as a proof of concept and also had an irradiaton chamber for further studies. It initially had a thermal effect of 300kW later raised to 1MW. Thea reactor was neither capable of power production or plutonium production but as a practice project it was invaluble. R1 was finally closed down on June 6 1970.

### R0
R0 was the second Swedish nuclear reactor built in Studsvik. Also a heavy water moderated, naural uranium fueled research reactor not for power production it was mainly used for research on core configaritions and fuel reqirements. I was closed down in 1972 ~~fanns den på riktigt?~~

### R2
~~inte färdig~~
R2 was a research reactor in studsvik of the same design as ORR in America delivered to AB Atomenergi by american company Allis-Chalmers. It went critical May 4 1960 and was used for materials research, fuel research, neutron experiments and production av radio-isotopes for medicin and industry. It closed down in 2005.


### Atoms for peace
During the first years after the second world war America banned the sharing of nuclear technology, even with their allies. This began to change after a 1953 speech to the Un general assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower about the hopes and dangers of a nuclear future. After this America became more generous in sharing information and equipment. In 1957 a UN conferens was helt concerning nuclear technology in which lots of previously secret information was released to the world. The nuclear states also agreed to the trade of both natural and enriched uranium. This eventually lead to the founding of IAEA in 1957 which were to regulate and control the trade. This sped up the development in Sweden leading to AB Atomenergi suggesting two new reactors, R3 and R4 as well as the founding of privately owned AKK (later OKG) who eventually became the first in sweden to consider construction of a light water reactor.

## Heavy water nuclear power plants

### Early plans
Based on discussions within Atomenergiutredningen Vattenfall made plans for two power producing Nuclear reactors, Adam and Eva. Atomenergi similarly had plans for two powerplants, R3 and R4. These project were later combined with R3/Adam becoming Ågestaverket and R4/Eva becoming Marvikenverket.

### Ågestaverket
Ågestaverket, in Ågesta, Huddinge, was to be the first Swedish nuclear power plant, delivering electricity and district heating. It was a joint venture combining project Adam from ASEA-Vattenfall and project R3 from AB Atomenergi. Planning began in 1957 and construction started in 1961. For safety reasons the reactor was placed underground in a bedrock cavity. The plant was designed by Vattenfall AB with the reactor designed by AB Atomenergi and buit by ASEA. The initial planned construction cost of 50 000 000SEK was badly overrun ending up at 530 000 000SEK by the time construction was complete. The reasons for the higher than expected cost was mainly that construction began before design was complete combined with a high demand on the materials used. The single reactor was a PWR model fuelled with natural uranium moderated by heavy water. By the time Ågestaverket was planned and constructed the Americans had started to release more iformation about their technology and the construction solutions of Ågetsaverket were in applicable parts heavily inspired by the Shippingport power plant.

The reactor first went critical in july 1963 and achived full power in 1964 delivering 12MW of electricity and 68 MW of district heating. The modest 15% efficency in converting heat energy to electrical was a feature, not a bug since spare thermal energy was used for district heating.

The Ågesta plant served as a demonstration plant proving the viabillity of the swedish line, running a nuclear power plant on nationally sourced natural uranium moderated with heavy water. A major uncertainity before was wheather the loss of heavy water would be to large to make it economically feasible but after the first year of operation this proved not to be the case. The plant stayed online for ten years from 1964 to 1974 and during that time delivered a total of 800 000MWh heat and 415 000 MWh electrical power.

The desicion to shut the plant down was taken out of economic considerations. New safety demands would require substansial investment and the plant was already operating at a loss. Due to the oil crisis the plant was making a profit during it's last year of operation but the decision to end operations had already been taken and the plant was finally shut down on June 2, 1974.

### Marvikenverket
Initial plans for Marvikenverket called for a heavy water moderated PWR fuelled with natural uranium having a thermal effect of 400MW and an electrical output of 100MW but due to fast development in the international nuclear industry plans kept changing. The most advanced for proposed was a heavy water BWR fuelled with enriched uranium producing 200MW of electrical power. The final plant had a heavy water BWR with a thermal effect of 474MW and electrical output of 132MW. Construction began in 1965 and the plant was ready for non-nuclear pilot operation in 1968.

By this time AEC had set out basic criteria for evaluating the safety of nuclear power plants. Marvikenverket failed to meet some of the safety criteria while attempting to remediate these problems during the autumn of 1969 new problems were discovered. Instead of further investment Atomenergi in 1970 suggested shutting the project down. Vattenfall agreed and final decision to close the project was granted by the goverment May 27, 1970. Final cost of construction and liquidation came to 640 000 000SEK.

While the plant never opened for operation it is generally agreed that the knowledge gained was instrumental for the Swedish nuclear industry. Without this project it is doubtful whether Sweden would have had the know how to independently develop light water reactor technology.

### slutet för den svenska linjen 1968

## Light water nuclear Power plants

### Private industry takes over the market
While state owned companies were planning and buiding power plants conforming with the needs of the Swedish line, private companies started looking in another direction. They saw the success of light water reactors using enriched uranium as fuel, something availlible on the market since the Americans had decided to start sharing some of their technology. 

### kort om amerikanska kärnkraftverk
~~~lite om rickover?~~
The worlds first civilian nuclear power plant, The Shippingport Atomic power station, unique in that it had no military purpose, first went critical December 12, 1957 and started putting power on the grid five months later on May 26, 1958. ~~kafa, flytta eller skriva om~~

## Oskarshamn
During the 1950s the Simpevarp peninsula in Oskarsman municipallity was prospected as a location of interest for future construction of a nuclear power plantby AKK and in 1959 they hand in the application for construction. The peninsula was bought by AKK in 1962 and they start moving out the previous inhabitants and prepare the site for construction. In total Oskarshamn would house 3 nuclear reactors.

#### Oskarshamn 1
in 1965 Oskarshamns Kraftgrupp (now OKG AB) is founded by AKK and they place an order with ASEA for a 400 MW power output light water BWR. This would become O1 (Oskarshamn reactor 1) and construction began 1 June, 1966. In 1971 it started producing power for the grid as the first commercial nuclear reactor in Sweden. Through modernizations the energy output was improved and it's maximum energy output was 473MW with a thermal effect of 1375MW. O1 was closed 17 June 2017.

#### Oskarshamn 2
Plans for a second reactor on the Simpevarp Peninsula began in 1967 and an order for a light water BWR producing 580MW of electricity was placed with ASEA. The same construction used for O2 would later be used for both the reactors in Barsebäck. In 1982 the effect output of O2 was increased to 638MW with a thermal effect of 1800MW. O2 was closed ~~datum?????~~

#### Oskarshamn 3
Plans for a third reactor was formulated in 1973 and an application for construction of a 1000MW electricity outut light water BWR reactor was made. An order was initially placed with ASEA/Stal-Laval in 1976 but due to a planned plebicite concerning the future of nuclear power production in sweden the order was put on hold until 1980. In 1985 O3 entered the grid with an electrical power output of 1050MW. It was modernized in 1989 increasing its effect to 1200MW and again in 2012 inccreasing the power output to 1450MW briefly making it the worlds most powerful BWR. The thermal effect of O3 is 3900MW.

#### shutdown
In an extra shareholders meeting 14 October, 2015 OKG's huvudägare E.ON decided to shut down O1 and O2. Low prices on electricity, partially driven by competition from wind power meant that the reactors were no longer profitable.

O1 was shut down 17 June 2017 having delivered a total of 109TWh of electricity. O2 was already closed for renovations when the decision to shut it down was made and it was never taken back online. O2 produced a total of 154TWh during its lifetime

~~kort om politiska motivationer~~


## Ringhals
in 1965 Vattenfall started buying land on Väröhalvön in värö land municipality, now part of Varberg municipality. 1966-1967 they were planning bids for their first two reactors and approval to build the plant was granted in 1968. Orders for a BWR from Asea, R1 (Ringhals 1) and a PWR, R2 (Ringhals 2) from American Westinghouse were placed the same year and construction began in 1961. Orders for two more PWR's, R3 and R4, were placed with Westinghouse in 1970. ~~The three Westinghouse reactors in Ringhals are the only power plant reactors in Sweden not developed domestically and the only PWR's.~~

#### Ringhals 1
R1 is a BWR, the only one in ringals. The order for the reactor was placed with ASEA in 1969 and construction began in the beginning of the same year. Problems with sub-contractors caused delays but the reactor tank was delivered in 1970. First criticallity was in 1973 and power delivery began the next year with full commercial operations in 1976. Initially the net power output was 730MW but through modernizations it has now been raised to 855MW with a thermal effect of 2540MW. R1 was closed 31 December, 2020

#### Ringhals 2
R2 is a PWR delivered by westinghouse, the order was placed in 1969 and construction began in 1970. Due to delivery problems of components for R1, R2 was the first reactor to go live in the Ringhals plant when it entered the net in 1974 with full commercial operation in 1975. R2 delivered a net power output of 866MW with a thermal effect of 2652MW. R2 was closed in 2019.

#### Ringhals 3
R3 is a PWR delivered by Wesinghouse. It was ready to begin operations in 1977 but could not be loaded with fuel due to a new law (villkorslagen) dictating that new reactors could not begin operations without a plan for safe disposal of spent fuel. After making such plans approval to fuel and start the reactor was given 27 March, 1979, tha day before the Three Mile Island accident. After the TMI accident it was decided to hold a plebicite about the future of nuclear power production in Sweden and no new reactors were allowed to begin operations until the results were in. This led to further delays but power production could finally begin in 1980 with full commercial operation commencing in 1981. Power output is 1045MW with a thermal effect of 3135MW.

#### Ringhals 4
R4 Is a PWR delivered by Westinghous of the same construction as R3. Start of the reactor was planned for 1981 but problems discovered with R3 delayed operatiosn until these had been remediated. It started power production in 1982 with full cemmercial operation commencing in 1983. It delivers 935Mw of power with a thermal effect of 2775MW.


## Barsebäck

Barsebäck was a nuclear power plant in Barsebäck, Kävlinge municiaplity. Land for the plant was bought by Sydkraft in 1965 and initially considerations were made to in accordence with närförläggningsutredningen use it for both electrical power production and district heating. The location meant that district heating could be delivered to bot Malmö and Lund as well as Danish Copenhagen. These plans were however abandoned since it would negatively effect the electrical power production which was deemed more important. The fact that plant was close to Denmark has  made it controversial since early on with both Swedish and Danish enviromentalist movements protesting the plant. The two reactors were taken offline in 1999 and 2005 as part of an energy deal between the political parties Socialdemokraterna, Vänsterpartiet and Centerpartiet in 1997. throughout their lifetime the two reactors produced a total of 201 860 GWeh.

### Barsebäck 1
B1 was a BWR delivered by Asea. The order was placed in 1969 and construction began 1971. It had a net effect of 600MWe and a thermal effect of 1800MWth. It started delivering power in 1975 and was closed down in 1999 having delivered a total of 93.82MWeh.

### Barsebäck 2
B2 was also a BWR delivered by Asea. The order was placed in 1970 and construction began in 1973. After the 1976 election the Swedish goverment were led by anti nuclear Thorbjörn Fälldin who had promised during his campaign that no new reactors would enter operations. Fällding was however forced to a compromise in the autumn of 1976 allowing the fuelling of B2 to begin. Full commercial operations began in 1977 and when the reactor was shut down in 2005 it had delivered a total of 108-45TWeh.
