~~The initial plans for Marviken or R4/Eva called for a heavy water moderated PWR using natural uranium with an electrical power output of 100MW, due to quick development of reactor technology and release of previously secret information from the Americans, the plans would change frequently during the development process.~~

~~The plant was a joint construction between Vattenfall and Atomenergi AB with ASEA Atom as the main supplier. Fuel would be supplied by Atomenergi AB~~

Initial plans for Marvikenverket called for a heavy water moderated PWR fuelled with natural uranium having a thermal effect of 400MW and an electrical output of 100MW but due to fast development in the international nuclear industry plans kept changing. The most advanced for proposed was a heavy water BWR fuelled with enriched uranium producing 200MW of electrical power. The final plant had a heavy water BWR with a thermal effect of 474MW and electrical output of 132MW. Construction began in 1965 and the plant was ready for non-nuclear pilot operation in 1968.

By this time AEC had set out basic criteria for evaluating the safety of nuclear power plants. Marvikenverket failed to meet some of the safety criteria while attempting to remediate these problems during the autumn of 1969 new problems were discovered. Instead of further investment Atomenergi in 1970 suggested shutting the project down. Vattenfall agreed and final decision to close the project was granted by the goverment May 27, 1970. Final cost of construction and liquidation came to 640 000 000SEK.

While the plant never opened for operation it is generally agreed that the knowledge gained was instrumental for the Swedish nuclear industry. Without this project it is doubtful whether Sweden would have had the know how to independently develop light water reactor technology.
