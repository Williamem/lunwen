## Ringhals
in 1965 Vattenfall started buying land on Väröhalvön in värö land municipality, now part of Varberg municipality. 1966-1967 they were planning bids for their first two reactors and approval to build the plant was granted in 1968. Orders for a BWR from Asea, R1 (Ringhals 1) and a PWR, R2 (Ringhals 2) from American Westinghouse were placed the same year and construction began in 1961. Orders for two more PWR's, R3 and R4, were placed with Westinghouse in 1970. ~~The three Westinghouse reactors in Ringhals are the only power plant reactors in Sweden not developed domestically and the only PWR's.~~

#### Ringhals 1
R1 is a BWR, the only one in ringals. The order for the reactor was placed with ASEA in 1969 and construction began in the beginning of the same year. Problems with sub-contractors caused delays but the reactor tank was delivered in 1970. First criticallity was in 1973 and power delivery began the next year with full commercial operations in 1976. Initially the net power output was 730MW but through modernizations it has now been raised to 855MW with a thermal effect of 2540MW. R1 was closed 31 December, 2020

#### Ringhals 2
R2 is a PWR delivered by westinghouse, the order was placed in 1969 and construction began in 1970. Due to delivery problems of components for R1, R2 was the first reactor to go live in the Ringhals plant when it entered the net in 1974 with full commercial operation in 1975. R2 delivered a net power output of 866MW with a thermal effect of 2652MW. R2 was closed in 2019.

#### Ringhals 3
R3 is a PWR delivered by Wesinghouse. It was ready to begin operations in 1977 but could not be loaded with fuel due to a new law (villkorslagen) dictating that new reactors could not begin operations without a plan for safe disposal of spent fuel. After making such plans approval to fuel and start the reactor was given 27 March, 1979, tha day before the Three Mile Island accident. After the TMI accident it was decided to hold a plebicite about the future of nuclear power production in Sweden and no new reactors were allowed to begin operations until the results were in. This led to further delays but power production could finally begin in 1980 with full commercial operation commencing in 1981. Power output is 1045MW with a thermal effect of 3135MW.

#### Ringhals 4
R4 Is a PWR delivered by Westinghous of the same construction as R3. Start of the reactor was planned for 1981 but problems discovered with R3 delayed operatiosn until these had been remediated. It started power production in 1982 with full cemmercial operation commencing in 1983. It delivers 935Mw of power with a thermal effect of 2775MW.
