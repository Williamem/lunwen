During the 1950s the Simpevarp peninsula in Oskarsman municipallity was prospected as a location of interest for future construction of a nuclear power plantby AKK and in 1959 they hand in the application for construction. The peninsula was bought by AKK in 1962 and they start moving out the previous inhabitants and prepare the site for construction.

#### O1
in 1965 Oskarshamns Kraftgrupp (now OKG AB) is founded by AKK and they place an order with ASEA for a 400 MW light water BWR. This would become O1 (Oskarshamn reactor 1) and construction began 1 June, 1966. In 1971 it started producing power for the grid as the first commercial nuclear reactor in Sweden. Through modernizations the energy output was improved and it's maximum energy output was 473MW with a thermal effect of 1375MW.

Oskarshamn would eventually house two more reactors, O2 and O3.

#### O2
Plans for a second reactor on the Simpevarp Peninsula began in 1967 and an order for a light water BWR producing 580MW of electricity was placed with ASEA. The same construction used for O2 would later be used for both the reactors in Barsebäck. In 1982 the effect output of O2 was increased to 638MW with a thermal effect of 1800MW.

#### O3
Plans for a third reactor was formulated in 1973 and an application for construction of a 1000MW electricity outut light water BWR reactor was made. An order was initially placed with ASEA/Stal-Laval in 1976 but due to a planned plebicite concerning the future of nuclear power production in sweden the order was put on hold until 1980. In 1985 O3 entered the grid with an electrical power output of 1050MW. It was modernized in 1989 increasing its effect to 1200MW and again in 2012 inccreasing the power output to 1450MW briefly making it the worlds most powerful BWR. The thermal effect of O3 is 3900MW.

#### shutdown
In an extra shareholders meeting 14 October, 2015 OKG's huvudägare E.ON decided to shut down O1 and O2. Low prices on electricity, partially driven by competition from wind power meant that the reactors were no longer profitable.

O1 was shut down 17 June 2017 having delivered a total of 109TWh of electricity. O2 was already closed for renovations when the decision to shut it down was made and it was never taken back online. O2 produced a total of 154TWh during its lifetime

1965 bildades Oskarshamnsverkets Kraftgrupp AB (nu OKG AB) med delvis samma
delägare som i AKK och den 14 juli 1965 beställde OKG det första kommersiella
kärnkraftverket i Sverige, Oskarshamn 1. Det var en BWR på 400 MW konstruerad av
Asea utan någon licens från General Electric. Kostnad för den nyckelfärdiga
anläggningen var 300 miljoner kronor. https://www.stralsakerhetsmyndigheten.se/contentassets/cc1a3c563fd3457a8787b88f0f42b9e2/200718-marvikenreaktorn---ett-industripolitiskt-utvecklingsprojekt-i-otakt-med-tiden
