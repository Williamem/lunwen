During the 1950s the Simpevarp peninsula in Oskarsman municipallity was prospected as a location of interest for future construction of a nuclear power plantby AKK and in 1959 they hand in the application for construction. The peninsula was bought by AKK in 1962 and they start moving out the previous inhabitants and prepare the site for construction.

in 1965 Oskarshamns Kraftgrupp (now OKG AB) is founded and they place an order with ASEA Atom for a 400 MW BWR. This would become O1 (Oskarshamn reactor 1) and construction began 1 June 1966

1965 bildades Oskarshamnsverkets Kraftgrupp AB (nu OKG AB) med delvis samma
delägare som i AKK och den 14 juli 1965 beställde OKG det första kommersiella
kärnkraftverket i Sverige, Oskarshamn 1. Det var en BWR på 400 MW konstruerad av
Asea utan någon licens från General Electric. Kostnad för den nyckelfärdiga
anläggningen var 300 miljoner kronor. https://www.stralsakerhetsmyndigheten.se/contentassets/cc1a3c563fd3457a8787b88f0f42b9e2/200718-marvikenreaktorn---ett-industripolitiskt-utvecklingsprojekt-i-otakt-med-tiden
