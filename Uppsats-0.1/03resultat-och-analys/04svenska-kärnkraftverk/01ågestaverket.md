# Ågestaverket

~~Ågestaverket or R3/Adam was the first power producing Swedish nuclear reactor. It was a joint project between Vattanfall and AB Atomenergi and construction began in 1957. The plant was fully constructed in 1962 with a final construction cost of 230 million SEK, far more than the projected 50 million SEK. The reactor achived first criticallity 17 july 1963. Commercial power production began in 1964~~

Ågestaverket was the first commercial Swedish nuclear power plant. It had one reactor named R3/Adam. Apart from delivering electrical power and district heating it was also meant to test technology and fuel. R3/Adam was a PWR (Pressurized Water Ractor) initially delivering a thermal effect of 65MW, later 80MW. The electrical power produced was modest at 15%, 12MW but this was by design since the main delivery of energy was in the form of district heating at 68MW.

Data:
purpose: demonstration plant, electrical power production, district heating
Type: PWR
design by:
Constructed by (company): stockholms elverk
NOHAB (refuelling machine),
Degerfors Foundry (reactor tank)
Owned by: Vattenfall, AB Atomenergi
Operated by:
Moderator: Heavy Water
Fuel: Natural Uranium in the form of uranium oxide encapsulated in zircaloy
Location: Ågesta, Huddinge (in a bedrock cavity)
Constructed: 1957-1962
first criticality: 17 July 1963
Estimated cost of construction: 50 000 000SEK
Final cost of construction: 530 000 000SEK (contributing factor, rushed pace, construction began before deciding on pressure vessel or pressure tube. high demands on materials)
Operation cost:
Open: 1964-2 June 1974
Thermal output: initially 65MW, later increased to 80MW
Power production: electricity 12MW, District heating 68MW
(mer om det östman s34)
reason for shutdown: sttricter safety requirements, low profitabillity, old technology with low output compared to more modern plants
verkningsgrad: 15%

(Operations at full power commenced at the start of 1964. Even though Ågesta was a development project operational reliability was still good. Taking planned interruptions into consideration, the average availability figure for all its years in operation was 84% and during the last four operating years the figure approached 100%. The most serious disruption occurred in 1968 when fuel failure caused a seven-month long breakdown.)
